"""Classes for supervised learning/training in Trax.

Trax provides classes for training supervised models:

  - Loop: Core training loop for an n-step training session, starting from
    random initialization.

  - TrainTask: Labeled data + feedback mechanism (loss function w/ optimizer)
    for modifying a model's weights.

  - Optimizer: How to compute model weight updates using loss-derived gradients.
    May contain state ("slots", 1-1 with model weights) that accumulates across
    training steps. (This class is defined in the optimizers package.)

  - EvalTask: How and when to measure model performance as a function of
    training step number.

class Loop:
  """Loop that can run for a given number of steps to train a supervised model.

  The typical supervised training process randomly initializes a model and
  updates its weights via feedback (loss-derived gradients) from a training
  task, by looping through batches of labeled data. A training loop can also
  be configured to run periodic evals and save intermediate checkpoints.

  For speed, the implementation takes advantage of JAX's composable function
  transformations (specifically, `jit` and `grad`). It creates JIT-compiled
  pure functions derived from variants of the core model; schematically:

    - training variant: jit(grad(pure_function(model+loss)))
    - evals variant: jit(pure_function(model+evals))

  In training or during evals, these variants are called with explicit
  arguments for all relevant input data, model weights/state, optimizer slots,
  and random number seeds:

    - batch: labeled data
    - model weights/state: trainable weights and input-related state (e.g., as
      used by batch norm)
    - optimizer slots: weights in the optimizer that evolve during the training
      process
    - random number seeds: JAX PRNG keys that enable high-quality, distributed,
      repeatable generation of pseudo-random numbers
